Assingment 2 - Jesus Gonzalez and Ryan Garcia
This program is the implementation of the Aquarium simulation

Program written in Python 2.7
Scipy, Numpy was used in this program
IDE used was Pycharm
The only file needed for this is the "Simulation.py" file which contains all the code needed

The program default inputs are set to 300 mackerel and 150 but can be changed through the X0 variable. (Code line 25)
The program will confirm that the system is periodic with a period of 5. When the program is executed, it will display 60 states
Each state is a minute passed, at each 5 miniute mark the output will show the population of both species returning back to an initial state
this represents the plot in a sin wave kind of behavior

As well if the program begins with 15 and 22. You will see in the results, that at some point in the simulation the mackerel reach a population less than 1.
But because when the last one died, it left secret piles of eggs hidden from the sharks, those eggs were able to resurrect the extinct species to later thrive again!

All the data metrics will be displayed in the output when you run the program
